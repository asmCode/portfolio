		<![CDATA[
		Bunnies & Rabbies is a mixture of FPP shooter and "game-of-life-like" simulation:<br>
		just try to keep colony of sweet bunnies alive as long as you can by eliminating infected individuals in old-fashioned
		way (with a stick of a dynamite and 12 gauge shotgun).<br>
		<br>
		There are two kinds of rabbits in this game: healthy, pink ones and brown infected with rabies.
		Rabbits' population is growing and your task is to keep infected ones at bay so they don't transmit their disease any further.
